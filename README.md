# videoconvert
A ffmpeg wrapper to drive it for video conversion, without dealing with the complicated command line interface.

# Introduction
Particularity of this wrapper is that it is independent on any external library; you only need "out of the box" python stuff.
It is a wrapper around the `ffmpeg` tool that rescale and change bitrate of a video file mapping a clean and easy command line interface to the `ffmpeg`'s complex one.
